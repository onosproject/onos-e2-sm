This is an analysis of MeasurementData structure APER encoding per KPM v2.0.3 definition:
https://github.com/onosproject/onos-e2-sm/blob/e6dc49d1cd9f4554e11856f1a2a0aeac33034f71/servicemodels/e2sm_kpm_v2_go/v2/e2sm_kpm_v2_go.proto#L548

0x00 0x07 - is a size of MeasurementData structure (list)

---> Drilling down to MeasurementDataItem structure
0 - stands for SEQUENCE is not extended for MeasurementDataItem.
1 - stands for OPTIONAL item incompleteFlag is present.
---> Drilling down to MeasurementRecord structure
00 - describes the length of the bytes (1, i.e., 0 above 1) which carry the length of the MeasurementRecord structure (list).
0000 - Octet-alignment.

It gives us 0x40.

Next byte, 0x01, gives the length of the MeasurementRecord structure (list). It is 1, so expecting 1 item.

---> Drilling Down to MeasurementRecordItem
0 - stands for CHOICE is not extended.
00 - is a CHOICE index, i.e., 0 -> Integer.
0 0 - describes the length of the bytes (1, i.e., 0 above 1) which carry the INTEGER number.
000 - Octet-alignment.

It gives us 0x00.
Next byte describes the number which is carried in MeasurementRecordItem->Integer option. It is 0x00.
In case of MeasurementRecordItem->Integer is 5, the byte would be 0x05.

We're returning to MeasurementDataItem and continuing to encode it. Next item is incompleteFlag


0 - stands for ENUMERATED (incompleteFlag) is not extended.
---> Value of IncompleteFlag is fixed (there is only single option, so no need to carry it -> not encoded)
--> Drilling down to another MeasurementDataItem
0 - stands for SEQUENCE is not extended for MeasurementDataItem.
1 - stands for OPTIONAL item incompleteFlag is present.
---> Drilling down to MeasurementRecord structure
0 0 - describes the length of the bytes (1, i.e., 0 above 1) which carry the length of the MeasurementRecord structure (list).
000 - Octet-alignment.

It gives us 0x20.
Next byte, 0x01, gives the length of the MeasurementRecord structure (list). It is 1, so expecting 1 item.
