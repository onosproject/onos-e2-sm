This is an analysis of MeasurementLabel structure APER encoding per KPM v2.0.3 definition:
https://github.com/onosproject/onos-e2-sm/blob/e6dc49d1cd9f4554e11856f1a2a0aeac33034f71/servicemodels/e2sm_kpm_v2_go/v2/e2sm_kpm_v2_go.proto#L181

Measurement Label PER analysis

0 - indicates that MeasurementLabel is not Extended (but could potentially be)
1 - Indicates that PLMN-ID, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that Slice-ID, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that FiveQI, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that QFI, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that QCI, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that QCImax, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that QCImin, which is OPTIONAL, present
----- This gives 7f byte

1 - Indicates that ARPmax, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that ARPmin, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that bitrateRange, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that layerMU-MIMO, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that SUM, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that distBinX, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that distBinY, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that distBinZ, which is OPTIONAL, present
----- This gives ff byte

1 - Indicates that preLabelOverride, which is OPTIONAL, present
1 - Indicates that startEndInd, which is OPTIONAL, present
00 0000 - Octet alignment
----- This gives c0 byte

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Next 3 bytes are dedicated to PLMN-ID since it is fixed size Octet String
----- 01 02 03 is a value of PLMN-ID

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Next goes SNSSAI which is a structure
0 - indicates that SNSSAI is not Extended (but could potentially be)
1 - indicates that OPTIONAL item (SD - Octet string of size 3) is present
--- Next goes Octet representing SST (octet string of size 1 octets), which is exactly one Octet long
0011 1111
00 0000 - is an Octet alignment
----- This gives us 4f c0 bytes

Next goes OPTIONAL part of SNSSAI structure - SD which is 3 byte Octet string
----- 01 02 03 is a value of SD item in SNSSAI, which has fixed size of 3 bytes (3 Octets)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Next goes FiveQI structure (constrained Integer which could be extended)
0 - indicates that FiveQI value is not Extended (but could potentially be)
-- next 3 bits carry length of a value (in bits) --> 255 need 8 bits to carry this number, 8 could be encoded with 3 bits
000 - we need 1 byte to carry value
0000 - Octet Alignment
----- In result we have 00 byte

Next goes value of FiveQI
0a - corresponds to 10, which is an encoded value of FiveQI
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now goes QFI structure
0 - indicates that QFI value is not Extended (but could potentially be)
--- next 3 bits carry length of a value (in bits) --> 63 need 6 bits to carry this number, 6 could be encoded with 3 bits
111 - 


--------------------------------------
Now goes ARP structure
0 - indicates that ARP(max) value is not Extended (but could potentially be)
1110 - this is a value of ARPmax, which is 15 (14 over 1)
0 - indicates that ARP(min) value is not Extended (but could potentially be)
0000 - this is a value of ARPmin, which is 1 (0 over 1)
00 0000 - Octet alignment
----- This gives us 70 00 bytes
